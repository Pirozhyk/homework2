    <p><b>Who is Marshmello?</b></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Marshmello is an electronic dance music producer and DJ.</strong>
        <i>He wears a custom helmet for public appearances. His identity is unknown. It has been frequently suggested that Marshmello is American DJ Chris Comstock, also known as Dotcom,
        whose style is similar to Marshmello's. Skrillex also referred to Marshmello as "Chris" in an interview. In addition, both are managed by Moe Shalizi and allegedly have the same tattoo and birthday.

    <p><strong><i>Musical style</i></strong></p>
    <br/>
    <p>His musical style includes groove-oriented, synth and bass-heavy electronic dance music. Inspired by other masked DJs like Deadmau5 and Daft Punk, Marshmello appears wearing a full-head-covering white coloured bucket. Despite the anonymity, his career
        received international recognition in 2015 when he began releasing tracks online, including remixes of Zedd's "Beautiful Now", Jack Ü's "Where Are You Now" and others, as well as his own single "Alone".

        <strong>After his set at Electric Daisy Carnival in 2016, Marshmello jokingly "revealed" his true identity by taking off his helmet, but the performer on-stage was revealed to actually be the Dutch producer Tiësto. 
    The event was widely described as being a "troll", as the two artists have been seen with each other in other photos and had conflicting tour schedules, thus making it unlikely that Marshmello was actually Tiësto.
